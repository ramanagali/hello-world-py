# Pre Merge Workflow - CI Pipeline
![PreCI](/diagrams/images/Diagrams-PreCI.drawio.png)

## Commit Workflow

- Run linters to catch Python syntax or style errors (e.g., using flake8).
- Check for sensitive data using git-secrets.
- Format code using Black for Python.
- Run tests using a testing framework like pytest.

## Pre-commit hook setup prerequisites

- **flake8**: Install using pip install flake8.
  - **Coding style**: Flake8 **checks** against coding style guidelines, such as PEP 8
  - **Programming errors**: Flake8 detects and reports syntax errors, typos, and other potential bugs
  - **Complex constructs**: Flake8 checks for complex constructs in the code
- **git-secrets**: **Prevents** from committing passwords and other sensitive information
  - scans commits, commit messages, and --no-ff merges to prevent adding secret.
  - If a commit, commit message, or any commit in a --no-ff merge history matches one of your configured prohibited regular expression patterns, then the commit is rejected.
  - git secrets –scan
  - git secrets --scan-history
- **Black**: Install using pip install black.
  - PEP 8 compliant Python opinionated formatter
  - reformats entire files in place
- **pytest**: Install using pip install pytest.
  - Simplifies the process of writing and executing tests
  - Reduces boilerplate code, making tests more concise and expressive

Save the hello-world-py/git-hooks/pre-commit.sh script to.git/hooks/pre-commit in the repository chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

## Pre-Push workflow

- - Run Python tests to ensure functionality and prevent breaking changes.
    - Enforce code coverage thresholds using coverage.py.
    - Verify commit messages follow the required pattern (SHK-12345).
    - Ensure compliance with Python code style rules using flake8.

3. Create RoleBinding called "rolebinding" with above "role1", "svc_dev"
4. Create test configmap "dev_cm" which has key value "Name": "GVR"
5. Create pod "dev_pod" with service account "svc_test", which should mount " dev_cm"

### Network Policies

1. Deny ingress and egress traffic by default
2. Allow communication from ingress pods to application pods
3. Deny intercommunication between pods

### Admission Controllers – PodSecurityAdmission

1. **Purpose**: Enforces namespace-level security policies for Pods based on Pod Security Standards (e.g., restricted, baseline, privileged).
2. **Security Benefit**:
    - Restrict running privileged containers.
    - Control capabilities like hostPID, hostNetwork, and hostIPC
    - Enforce the use of non-root users, specific AppArmor profiles, and Seccomp policies

### Security policies – Enforce – Kyverno

- **Purpose**: A Kubernetes-native **policy engine** that enforces, validates, and mutates configurations **based on YAML-like policy definitions**.
- **Features**:
  - Automatically inject security configurations (e.g., readOnlyRootFilesystem: true).
  - Validate configurations (e.g., ensure only approved container images are used).
  - Generate default resources (e.g., network policies, resource quotas)
- **Example1**: Enforce readOnlyRootFilesystem for Containers
  - securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem = true
- **Example2**: Prevent Running Privileged Containers
  - securityContext. Privileged = false
- **Example3:** allow known Image Registries
  - containers.image = "trusted-registry.com/\*"
- **Example4**: Enforce Containers run as Non-Root User
  - securityContext.runAsNonRoot= false
- **Example5**: Enforce Resource requests and Limits
  - Containers.resources.requests.memory
  - Containers.resources.requests.cpu
  - Containers.resources.limit.memory
  - Containers.resources.limit.cpu
- **Example6**: Disallow use of latest image tag
  - containers image: "!\*:latest"
- **Example7**: Ensure Labels for Resource Identification
  - Pods must have 'app' and 'env' labels.
- **Example8**: Disallow the use of hostPath volumes
  - spec.volumes.hostpath: null
- **Example9**: Enforce a default deny all NetworkPolicy is applied to namespace
  - default-deny-all network policy
- **Example10: Audit Non-Compliant Resources**
  - Sdafsda
- **Example11**: Integrate Kyverno with image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair)
  - vulnerabilities.critical
- **Example12**: Disallow default service account
  - serviceAccountName == 'default'
- **Example13**: Set Image pull policy IfNotPresent
  - imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
- **Example14**: Generete default deny network policy
  - Deny Ingress and Egress traffic

### Security policies – Enforce – using Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper

- **Purpose**: Enforces fine-grained, **custom policies using Rego**, a policy language. It works by validating and mutating resources based on defined constraints.
- **Features:**
  - Ensure all Pods use specific labels, annotations, or security contexts.
  - Restrict the use of certain container images.
  - Enforce naming conventions, RBAC rules, and more
- Set default **enforcementAction** to **deny**
- **Example1**: Namespace must have label env
- **Example2**: Restrict images from docker.io
- **Example3**: Resource names start with a specific prefix
- **Example3**: Ensures that all RBAC resources have a specific label

- Kubernetes Threat Detection (KTD): Monitors GKE for malicious or suspicious activity

### Runtime syscall monitoring using Falco Rules

- Create falco rules to monitor linux system calls

#### Admission Controllers

- **Security policies – AlwaysPullImages**
  - **Purpose**: Forces every Pod to pull container images before starting, even if the image is already cached on the node.
  - **Security Benefit**: Prevents Pods from using potentially stale or tampered images from the local node cache.
- **Security policies – LimitRanger**
  - **Purpose**: Ensures Pods and containers have appropriate CPU/memory requests and limits defined.
  - **Security Benefit**: Prevents resource exhaustion in the cluster.
- **Security policies – ResourceQuota**
  - **Purpose**: Enforces resource quotas at the namespace level.
  - **Security Benefit**: Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting resource consumption.
- **Security policies – DenyEscalatingExec**
  - **Purpose**: Blocks exec and attach commands to privileged containers.
  - **Security Benefit**: Prevents privilege escalation through interactive access to sensitive containers.

### Enable the AuditLogs for Control plane components

- The cluster audits the activities
- generated by users, by applications that use the Kubernetes API
- and control plane as well
- **Example**: When someone delete the pod/deployment/service in PROD namespace; log it  

### Don't run containers in privileged mode (privileged = false)

- The cluster audits the activities

### Use kernel hardening tools such as AppArmor, seccomp

- restricting the system calls & Kernel Security Module to granular access control for programs

### Adopt Service Mesh for pod to pod encryption using mTLS

- mTLS: Is secure communication between pods
- With service mesh Istio & Linkerd mTLS is easier, managable
- mTLS can be Enforced or Strict

### Use Distroless/Slim/Minimal Images

- Distroless Images will have only your app & runtime dependencies
- No package managers, shell, n/w tools, text editors etc
- Distroless images are very small

### Encrypt Kubernetes secrets

- For EKS, GKE or AKS clusters, encrypt the secrets with its dedicated CMK keys

### Leverage botkube live monitoring for all namespaces and all activities

- Leverage opensource troubleshooting and monitoring tool “botkube” which helps to provide live event alerts namespaces and events.

### Setup Prometheus Server & Grafana Operator to monitor Kubernetes workloads

- Setup Prometheus & Grafana Operator framework in dedicated monitoring server/cluster
- Monitor metrics, time series data
- Configure scrape targets and service discovery for audit, history and monitoring purpose
